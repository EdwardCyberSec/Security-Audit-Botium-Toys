<h1>Security Audit - Botium Toys</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As part of Google’s cybersecurity certificate program, I participated in an extensive internal IT audit for Botium Toys, a fictional small U.S. company specializing in toy development and sales. The company’s growing online presence, attracting customers both domestically and internationally, has placed increasing demands on its information technology (IT) department to support the global market.

Recognizing the need for an internal IT audit, the IT manager at Botium Toys aimed to address concerns related to business continuity, compliance, and infrastructure security. The goal was to identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets as the company continues to expand. Additionally, compliance with regulations related to online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.) was a top priority.

To kick off the audit process, the IT manager adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to establish a structured approach. This involved defining the audit scope and goals, followed by a thorough risk assessment. The primary objective was to gain an overview of the risks the company faces in its current security posture.

As a member of the audit team, my responsibilities included reviewing the IT manager’s audit scope, goals, and risk assessment. I conducted an internal audit of the company’s assets, controls, and adherence to compliance regulations and standards, aiming to enhance the company’s security posture.

Furthermore, I was tasked with effectively communicating my findings and recommendations to the IT manager and other stakeholders. This would enable them to implement necessary controls, create appropriate documentation, establish processes, and ensure business continuity, safeguard critical assets, and maintain compliance.

Subsequently, I conducted an internal audit to assess controls and verify compliance against relevant standards and requirements.
